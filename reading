chapter 1
粗略看了一遍，不知道英语老师这样要求的意义是什么。
review:
In this part,the novel show a ceremony for us.The four word"Tradition""Honor""Discipline""Excellence"are the Welston Academy's pillars.
The headmaster hosted thr ceremon,and expliaining  these pillars seem to be a important part.
also boys are excited or unhappy,it is really usually in such school beging party.Their parents are so happy that they put themslves into a wonderful dream ---about their successful son.
They try to make their kids understand the honor to be a student of a famous excllent school.
Also our soul man is introduced,but in the first chapter,he seem to be unfamous.But all we know,the golden is light anyway.

review:
In this part,we can see the boys' dormitory.As mentioned above, the boys are unwilling to obey the rules.
They aren't pretty goog as the gentle face.Stiff todd,easy-going Neil,Charlie and so on.It's ture that
no one will alive in such sick atomosphere.Our headmater has a talk with four new students,shows his concern.
In the last,we can guess Neil's father is so neverous that Neil's face turning white.Oh,God ,isn't a stereotype?
